### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I recently graduated with my Masters in Computer Engineering from NYU Tandon, and I am currently working as a Assistant Research Scientist at NYU Tandon. 
### I have expertise in deep learning, computer vision and building privacy preserving systems, and I am currently looking for opportunities as a Machine Learning / Deep Learning Engineer where I can best use my skills. 
<!-- ### My last work position was at the Centre of Networked Intelligence, Indian Institute of Science. I worked on mobility data analysis, built epidemiological simulators and worked on serosurvey designs. -->
### I am interested in developing machine learning frameworks and bringing models to production.  
### Ask me about the future of electric mobility and the use of AI in the same. 

### You can reach me at mb7979@nyu.edu
